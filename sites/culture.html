<h1 class="col-md-12">OVERVIEW</h1>
<div style="display: flex;">
<p class="col-md-8">Korea is one of the oldest cultures in the world. Koreans have passed down their traditions and stories for centuries. The country started to become split between North Korea and South Korea in 1945, and since then the two Koreas have increased cultural differences.

Some of the South Korean traditional arts are ceramics, music, crafts, dance, and paintings. You can often see these displayed if you’re visiting the cultural and tourist areas of South Korea such as 인사동 (Insadong) or 명동 (Myeongdong). Korea is known for having a very weird culture, to a point it's very easy to confuse a foreigner.</p>

<h2 class="col-md-12">Korean Barbecue</h2>
<div style="display: flex;">
<p class="col-md-8">Korean barbecue (Korean: 고기구이, gogi-gu-i, 'meat roast') refers to the popular method in Korean cuisine of grilling meat, typically beef, pork, or chicken. Such dishes are often prepared on gas or charcoal grills built into the dining table itself. Some Korean restaurants that do not have built-in grills provide customers with portable stoves for diners to use at their tables. Alternatively, a chef uses a centrally displayed grill to prepare dishes to order.

The most representative form of gogi-gu-i is bulgogi, usually made from thinly sliced marinated beef sirloin or tenderloin. Another popular form is galbi, made from marinated beef short ribs.[1] However, gogi-gu-i also includes many other kinds of marinated and unmarinated meat dishes, and can be divided into several categories. Korean barbecue is popular in its home country, but has also gained popularity worldwide.

<h2 class="col-md-12">Bibimbap</h2>
<div style="display: flex;">
<p class="col-md-8">Bibimbap(/ˈbiːbɪmbæp/ BEE-bim-bap, from Korean 비빔밥 [pi.bim.p͈ap̚], literally "mixed rice"), sometimes romanized as bi bim bap or bi bim bop, is a Korean rice dish. The term "bibim" means mixing various ingredients, while the "bap" noun refers to rice. Bibimbap is served as a bowl of warm white rice topped with namul (sautéed and seasoned vegetables) or kimchi (traditional fermented vegetables) and gochujang (chili pepper paste), soy sauce, or doenjang (a fermented soybean paste). A raw or fried egg and sliced meat (usually beef) are common additions. The hot dish is stirred together thoroughly just before eating.

In South Korea, Jeonju, Jinju, and Tongyeong are especially famous for their versions of bibimbap.In 2011, the dish was listed at number 40 on the World's 50 most delicious foods readers' poll compiled by CNN Travel.

<h1 class="col-md-12">Greetings</h1>
<div style="display: flex;">
<p class="col-md-12"> Use a person’s formal title (i.e. Mr, Ms, Doctor) when addressing them for the first time, and continue to do so until they signal otherwise.
<br>
The most common way to greet in South Korea is with a bow.
<br> 
The casual bow is a dip of the head with eyes closed, sometimes accompanied by a slight bend from the waist. This type of greeting is used when informally greeting someone or walking past someone of a higher status.
<br>
Business interactions require a deeper bow, where the torso bends from the waist by about 30 degrees.
<br>
The deepest, most polite bow expresses sincerest gratitude or apology. One bends from their torso to around 45 degrees or at such an angle from which the head would have to stretch up to look into the face of the other person. The head is kept lowered in this greeting.
<br>
Handshakes are also used to greet in South Korea. To show great respect during this greeting, one may support the wrist of their right hand with their left as they shake.
<br> 
Women may also greet one another by reaching out both hands to touch and clasp the other womans’ hands.
<br>
A person in a position of service may put their hands together in front of their chest when greeting you or accepting something as an expression of gratitude.
<br>
Many Koreans who live in Australia hug or kiss as a part of greetings.

<h1 class="col-md-12">Etiquette</h1>
<div style="display: flex;">
<p class="col-md-12"> In Korea, people rarely thank one another for gestures of courtesy (e.g. holding open doors), nor do they generally apologise if they bump into one another on the street. Therefore, they generally do not require a profuse apology, a ‘thank you’ or even acknowledgement. Respect is exhibited in different ways.
Respect should always be shown to those that are older than you. This involves deferring to their opinion, waiting for their input and lowering your gaze if they are an elder.
Object, gifts and food should be offered and received with two hands.
Remove your hat when indoors.
It is best practice to remove your shoes before entering a Korean home.
Koreans are reasonably punctual and usually prompt. They tend to try and make the most of the time they have. In certain settings, this can come across as impatient.
